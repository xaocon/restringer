/**
 * Isolated sandbox environment for executing untrusted JavaScript code during deobfuscation.
 * 
 * SECURITY NOTE: This sandbox provides isolation and basic protections but is NOT truly secure.
 * It's better than direct eval() but should not be relied upon for security-critical applications.
 * The isolated-vm library provides process isolation but vulnerabilities may still exist.
 * 
 * This class provides an isolated VM context using the isolated-vm library to evaluate
 * potentially malicious JavaScript with reduced risk to the host environment. The sandbox includes:
 * 
 * Isolation Features:
 * - Separate V8 context isolated from host environment
 * - Blocked access to dangerous APIs (WebAssembly, fetch, WebSocket, etc.)
 * - Memory and execution time limits to prevent resource exhaustion
 * - Deterministic evaluation (Math.random and Date are deleted for consistent results)
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Reusable instances to avoid VM creation overhead
 * - Shared contexts for multiple evaluations
 * - Pre-configured global environment setup
 * 
 * Used extensively by unsafe transformation modules for:
 * - Evaluating binary expressions with literal operands
 * - Resolving member expressions on literal objects/arrays
 * - Execution of prototype method calls
 * - Local function call resolution with context
